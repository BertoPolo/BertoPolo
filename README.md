<b>Full-Stack Developer</b>
<hr/>
<p> When I was in high school I made a mistake choosing my professional career, I had always wanted to be a computer scientist, but for some reason I didn't.  At 30, I gave myself the opportunity to fulfill my dream and now I am finally a Full Stack Developer 💪🏼</p>
